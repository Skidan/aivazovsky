          <h3 class="data_heading">the Person</h3>
          <p class="data_text">Ivan Aivazovsky, the Armenian-Russian painter, undoubtedly was one of the most fascinating and richly talented artists of the past two centuries. Ethnically an Armenian, he was born the city of Feodosiya which was then a part of the Russian Empire. Today Feodosiya is a port city in the Crimean* Ukraine.</p>
          <p class="data_text">Although Aivazovsky was born in 1817 into a poor family, his father did an amazing job of providing him with a high quality education, teaching him to speak several languages fluently. The young Aivazovsky also showed extraordinary artistic potential from an early age, which proved to be his ticket to a future life of wealth and fame as one of Europe’s most brilliant artists.</p>
          <p class="data_text">Ivan Aivazovsky is by far most known for painting magnificent seascapes, and is considered to be among the best in this category, perhaps “the best” all of history. Fully half of all his life works, which were many, depict ocean scenes with ships, magnificent sunsets, cloudscapes, ships and waves. Other favorite subject matters for Aivazovsky were scenes of the Ukrainian countryside featuring the work and activities of peasants and small rural towns. He also painted rural scenes in the outlying areas of Istanbul.</p>
          <p class="data_text">Aivazovsky was able to travel widely in his long life of 82 years. One of the most significant locations for him would be Istanbul in modern-day Turkey. There he received a number of commissions from the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire. Many of his paintings are still on display today in the magnificent palaces of the former Ottoman rulers.</p>
